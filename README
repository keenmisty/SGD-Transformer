  This is a program to project your GeoTiff data to WGS1984, 
  reclassify to USGS 24-class and convert your data into 
  the MM5/WRF geogrid binary format.
  
  Notes:
  "Csh, Python(with numpy) and GDAL(with python bindings)" are requirement.
  Please check the environment of your computer first!
  
  Before run this program, you need to define something in the head
  of the "run_me" file.

  After the modify work, ./run_me and find result in output/
  
  A file named 00001-<NX>.00001-<NY> is created, where <NX> is the 
  argument nx and <NY> is the argument ny, both in i5.5 format.
  And a index file would created in the same place.

  Creat a new folder under geog path and copy these two output things inside.
  Add the rel_path(the folder name) and interp_option into your WPS/geogrid/GEOGRID.TBL 
  Then you can calling your modified datasets in your namelist.wps.

  Have fun!
